# rdf-ext-examples

RDF-Ext examples for Node.js and browser environments.
The [tutorial](https://rdf-ext.org/tutorial/) on the [RDF-Ext homepage](htttps://rdf-ext.org/) is based on this code.
Please have a look if you want more details. 

## Usage

If you don't use [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) or [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), you need to install the dependencies before you can run the examples:

```bash
npm ci
```

This repository contains a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) workspace.
You can use the preconfigured launch configurations if you use that IDE or any compatible IDE like Gitpod or Codespaces.
